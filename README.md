This is the Interactive Rating Challenge

Initial Commit:
This is still imcomplete.
Questions: 
Was the way I made the border behind the star img the best way? I was toying around with border-image but that didn't seem to have the functionality I wanted it to so I had to go with setting the background and the border the same color. 

2nd Update:
This is still incomplete.
Finished making the thank you card, got everything where I want it to be more or less. Will work on the JS logic next.

3rd Update:
This is "complete"
All the functionality is there but it doesn't look or feel as great as I'd like it to, there are some cool ones out there, I'd like to figure out how to maybe make the ratings turn into stars when you hover over them, and maybe how to make them fill up to the number you select before you submit. Need to put some transitions on the number buttons too and just generally clean up the code. The biggest thing I learned was that you don't have to use JS to change the state of the buttons on click but rather there is a pseudo selector called :focus which changes them. I'm happy with it though it was a fun challenge for me.
