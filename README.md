This is the Interactive Rating Challenge

Initial Commit:
This is still imcomplete.
Questions: 
Was the way I made the border behind the star img the best way? I was toying around with border-image but that didn't seem to have the functionality I wanted it to so I had to go with setting the background and the border the same color. 

2nd Update:
This is still incomplete.
Finished making the thank you card, got everything where I want it to be more or less. Will work on the JS logic next.
